        My name is Shane and I am a self-taught artist from Somers, Connecticut. I have always had a passion for art and have been drawing all my life.
        I went to college for studio art and started my apprenticeship after I graduated in 2009. I started tattooing full time in 2012. I specialize 
        in black and grey portaiture and animal design. My shop is located in Stafford Springs, CT and my bookings are open. In my free 
        time I like to read, listen to music, spend time with my friends, and draw.
